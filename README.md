this is the most fun I've had in recent times

this is a compilation of various helper libraries i made to make using C more enjoyable for me at least

- c_nice.h: a bunch of random functions that make some stuff easier
- c_arena.h: a simple arena implementation **stb_style**
- c_vector.h: a dynamic arena that can resize (can only hold a single type of var) **stb_style**
- c_string.h: an arguably better string implementation than C's null terminated strings **stb_style**
- c_http_server.h: a simple http server that can be single threaded or multi-threaded(requires pthread.h for the later)

note: these have been tested on linux but not on any other OS
